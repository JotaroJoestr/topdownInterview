Something to note is that sometimes it takes really long to equip and displaying the outfit as well as selling items. I normally spam the buttons until it's finally equiped.

I'm not really sure what causes this since im no expert but at the moment i hypothesize that too much tiles or maybe gameobject may cause the long equip time so i created a script to active and deactiveate the background enviroment using (G)key to help with the load.
